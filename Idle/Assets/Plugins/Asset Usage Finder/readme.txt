Asset Usage Finder v4.16

Importing new version of an asset:
1) Delete an old version of the product - Assets/DependencyPro folder
2) Import from Asset Store to Assets folder

IMPORTANT NOTICE:
In order to initialize cache for a project, you need to:
1) Run any usage search - File, Scene, Component
2) Wait for it to finish. It will take 4x less time any search took in v2.0
Benefits:
- Every other search will take less than 2 seconds. On huge projects, it should take less than 5 seconds
- Cache will be stored permanently and will be available after you close the project and turn off computer
- In case of changes that were made after cache initialization, only those changes will be cached. So you don't need to wait for cacheing of whole project every time
